**gitwalk** is a tool to manipulate multiple git repositories at once. You select
a group of repos using an [expression](https://github.com/pazdera/gitwalk#expressions)
and provide an [operation](https://github.com/pazdera/gitwalk#processors) to be
completed. Gitwalk will download the repos, iterate through them and run the
operation for each one. This may be searching through files and commits, running tests
and linters, editing files and pushing the changes back upstream &mdash; whatever you can
think of.

**gitwalk** is made in CoffeeScript and runs on Node.js. [nodegit](http://www.nodegit.org/) and
[node-github](https://github.com/mikedeboer/node-github) do most of the heavy lifting in the background.

## Installation

Gitwalk is distributed as an [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gitwalk) package.
Use the following command to install it on your system:

```bash
$ npm install -g gitwalk
```

Make sure to include `-g` to get the CLI command in your `$PATH`.

## Usage

The interface is pretty straight-forward. Here's the synopsis:

```
gitwalk [options] <expr...> <proc> <proc-args>
```

The first positional arguments are **expressions** that determine which
repositories will be processed. You can pass one or more of them at the same
time. The next one is your preferred **processor** which specifies what will
happen with the repositories, followed by any arguments that it takes &mdash;
usually a command, but different processors support different ones.

Check out the [expressions](#expressions) and [processors](#processors)
sections below for the details.

### Examples

Here are a few quick examples that should work out of the box. Paste them
in your terminal and see what happens.

```bash
$ gitwalk 'github:pazdera/tco:*' grep TODO

$ gitwalk '**/*' command 'tree .'

$ gitwalk 'github:pazdera/@(catpix|word_wrap)' commits 'echo "#{sha}: #{summary}"'
```

## Expressions

Expressions determine which repositories will be processed by the `gitwalk`
command. You can provide one or more of them and their results will be
combined. Check out the following examples:

```bash
# Matches all branches of the npm repo on GitHub.
$ gitwalk 'github:npm/npm:*' ...

# Matches all the git repositories in my home dir.
$ gitwalk '~/**/*' ...

# Use ^ to exclude previously matched repositories.
# Matches all my repos on GitHub _except_ of scriptster.
$ gitwalk 'github:pazdera/*' '^github:pazdera/scriptster' ...

# URLs work too.
$ gitwalk 'https://github.com/pazdera/tco.git:*' ...

# You can predefine custom groups of repositories.
# Check out the _Groups_ resolver below.
$ gitwalk 'group:all-js' 'group:all-ruby' ...
```

What comes after the last colon in each expression is interpreted as **branch
name**. If omitted, gitwalk assumes `master` by default. Also note that you can
use [globs](https://github.com/isaacs/node-glob#glob-primer) for certain parts.
Check out the detailed description of each resolver below for more information.

Under the hood, each type of expression is handled by a **resolver**. What
follows is a description of those that come with gitwalk by default. However,
it's really easy to add new ones. See the [contribution
guidelines](#contributing).

### GitHub

With this resolver, you can match repositories directly on GitHub. Gitwalk
will make queries to their API and clone the repositories automatically.

```
github:<username>/<repo>:<branch>
```

* **username**: GitHub username or organisation.
* **repo**: Which repositories to process (glob expressions allowed).
* _[optional]_ **branch**:  Name of the branch to process (glob expressions allowed).

#### Private repos

To be able to work with private repositories, you need to give gitwalk either
your credentials or auth token. Put this into your configuration file:

```json
{
  "resolvers": {
    "github": {
      "username": "example",
      "password": "1337_h4x0r",
      "token": "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
    }
  }
}
```

#### Push access

Pushing to repositories on GitHub again requires authentication. You'll need
to give gitwalk either your SSH keys or credentials via the config file. Here's
how to do it:

```json
{
  "git": {
    "auth": {
      "github-http-auth": {
        "pattern": "^https?\\:\\/\\/github\\.com",
        "username": "example",
        "password": "1337_h4x0r"
      },
      "github-ssh-auth": {
        "pattern": "^git@github\\.com",
        "public_key": "/Users/radek/.ssh/id_rsa.pub",
        "private_key": "/Users/radek/.ssh/id_rsa",
        "passphrase": ""
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Glob

You can match repositories on your file system using
[glob](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glob_(programming)). Note that gitwalk
will clone the repository even if it's stored locally on your computer. One
can never be too careful.

```
<path>:<branch>
```

* **path**: Location of the repositories (glob expressions allowed).
* _[optional]_ **branch**:  Name of the branch to process (glob expressions allowed).

### URL

URLs aren't a problem eiter. Gitwalk will make a local copy of the remote
repository and process it. However, you can't do any wildcard matching with
URLs.

```
<url>:<branch>
```

* **url**: An URL pointing to a git repository (glob **not** allowed).
* _[optional]_ **branch**:  Name of the branch to process (glob expressions allowed).

### Groups

You can define custom groups of expressions that you can refer to by name
later on. There are no predefined groups.

```
group:<name>
```

* **name**: Name of the group.

#### Configuring groups

Groups of expressions can be defined in the
[configuration file](#configuration) like this:

```json
{
  "resolvers": {
    "groups": {
      "all-ruby": [
        "github:pazdera/tco",
        "github:pazdera/scriptster",
        "github:pazdera/catpix"
      ],
      "c": [
          "github:pazdera/*itree*:*",
          "^github:pazdera/e2fs*"
      ],
      "c++": [
        "github:pazdera/libcity:*",
        "github:pazdera/OgreCity:*",
        "github:pazdera/pop3client:*"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

## Processors

Processors are tasks that you can run on each of the repositories that were
matched by your expressions. Just as with expressions, it's really easy to
add your own. Here are the ones that ship with gitwalk by default:

```bash
# Search for unfinished work in all JavaScript files
$ gitwalk ... grep '(TODO|FIXME)' '**/*.js'

# List all files in the repository
$ gitwalk ... command 'tree .'

# Another way to search the files
$ gitwalk ... command 'git grep "(TODO|FIXME)"'

# Replace the year in all Ruby files
$ gitwalk ... files '**/*.rb' 'sed -i s/2015/2016/g #{file}'

# Simple commit message profanity detector
$ gitwalk ... commits 'grep "(f.ck|sh.t|b.llocks)" <<<"#{message}"'
```

The `#{hashCurlyBraces}` templates will be expanded into values before the
command is executed. Each command exports different set of variables; check
out the detailed descriptions below to find out more.

### grep

Line-by-line search through all the files in the working directory using
regular expressions, similar to [grep](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grep).

```bash
$ gitwalk ... grep <pattern> [<files>]
```

* **regexp**: The pattern to look for.
* _(optional)_ **files**: Limit the search to certain files only (glob
expressions allowed). Searches all files by default.

### files

Run a custom command for each file in the repository. The `path` parameter
lets you match only certain files.

```bash
$ gitwalk ... files <path> <command>
```

* **path**: Path filter (glob expressions allowed).
* **command**: A command to run for each file
  * **Expored vars**
    * #{file}

### commits

Run a command for each

```bash
$ gitwalk ... commits <command>
```

* **command**: A command to run for each commit.
  * **Expored vars**
    * #{sha}
    * #{summary}
    * #{message}
    * #{author}
    * #{committer}

### command

Run a command per repository. This is useful for running custom scripts. The
current working directory for the command is set to the working tree of
gitwalk's local clone. You should be able to use the `git` command as usual.

```bash
$ gitwalk ... command <command>
```

* **command**: A command to run for each repository.


## Configuration

Providing a config file isn't mandatory. However, you'll need one if you want
to be able to git-push or access private repositories. Gitwalk loads the
following files:

* `~/.gitwalk.(json|cson)`
* `/etc/gitwalk.(json|cson)`

Both `json` and `cson` formats are accepted. Here's how a basic gitwalk config
might look like:

```json
{
  "resolvers": {
    "github": {
      "token": "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
    },
  },
  "git": {
    "auth": {
      "github-ssh": {
        "pattern": "^git@github\\.com",
        "public_key": "/Users/radek/.ssh/github.pub",
        "private_key": "/Users/radek/.ssh/github",
        "passphrase": ""
      }
    }
  },
  "logger": {
    "level": "debug"
  }
}
```

## JavaScript API

The JS API is similar to the CLI interface:

```js
var gitwalk = require('gitwalk');

gitwalk('github:pazdera/\*', gitwalk.proc.grep(/TODO/, '*.js'), function (err) {
    if (err) {
        console.log 'gitwalk failed (' + err + ')';
    }
});
```

## Contributing

If you found a bug, please [open a new issue](https://github.com/pazdera/gitwalk/issues)
with as much relevant information as possible. And in case you'd like to jump
in and get your hands dirty, here are a few ideas to get you started:

* Add new resolvers (BitBucket and other services)
* Add new processors (profanity search, integration with linters)
* The tests are atrocious (please help me write them!)
* Finish writing the API docs

If you start working on something, feel free to create an issue or drop me
a line to make sure you're not working on the same thing as somebody else.
